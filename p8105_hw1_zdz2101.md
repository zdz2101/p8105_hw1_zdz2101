Problem 1
=========

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

``` r
problem1_df <- tibble(numeric_vec = runif(n = 10, min = 0, max = 5),
                      logical_vec = numeric_vec > 2,
                      char_vec = c("My", "name", "is", "Zelos", "Zhu", "and", "I", "like", "to", "eat"),
                      factor_vec = factor(  c( rep( c("small", "medium", "large"), 3), "x-large")  )
                      )
print(problem1_df)
```

    ##  7       1.42  FALSE       I        small     
    ##  8       4.91  TRUE        like     medium    
    ##  9       0.230 FALSE       to       large     
    ## 10       0.418 FALSE       eat      x-large

``` r
#means <- apply(problem1_df, 2, mean) --- doesn't work, coerces all into NA, probably because there is non-numeric in it
```

``` r
means_prob1 <- c(mean(problem1_df$numeric_vec),
                 mean(problem1_df$logical_vec),
                 mean(problem1_df$char_vec),
                 mean(problem1_df$factor_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$char_vec): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## Warning in mean.default(problem1_df$factor_vec): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
means_prob1
```

    ## [1] 1.852019 0.400000       NA       NA

The mean() function successfully worked for the numeric and logical vectors of the data frame while it produced NAs for the character and factor vectors. This makes sense: the mean of the first vector could be calculated since it is a numeric variable, as a result the mean is 1.85. Interestingly enough, the second vector in the data frame could also have a mean and that is because R seems to automatically consider FALSE into 0 and TRUE into 1. So, taking a "mean" of a logical allows us to see the proportion of TRUE cases, similarly if we were to take the sum we would see the total counts of TRUE's. As expected, a mean could not be taken from neither the character or factor varaibles and that is because character and factor variables cannot be used with traditional "mathematical" functions.
